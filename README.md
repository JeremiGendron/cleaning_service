# Cleaning Service website gimmick

Instead of using a Wordpress template or hiring someone who will do that for an egregious price, I have made a gimmick which is related to the offered product/service to make people smile.

## Project setup
First, make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (recent stable) and [wasm-pack] installed.

Then, `cd wasm && wasm-pack && cd ../`

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```
